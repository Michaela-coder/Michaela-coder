"Hi there! I'm a scientist at heart, with a background in chemistry and healthcare, now diving into the world of Python programming. I love exploring the endless possibilities of AI and how it can transform the way we solve problems. When I'm not geeking out over code or experimenting with new tech, you’ll probably find me conjuring up cool ideas from my science days. Life’s a fun mix of chemistry and code, and I’m here for it!"
